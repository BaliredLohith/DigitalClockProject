# DigitalClock

The **DigitalClock** is a Java-based application that displays the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. It updates every second and offers features like showing seconds, toggling the second tick, and switching between time formats.

Users can customize the clock to either display time in a 12-hour format (with AM/PM) or a 24-hour format. The seconds display can be enabled or disabled, and an optional second tick sound is available. The clock automatically updates in real-time using Java's `Calendar` and `Date` APIs.

## Key Features:
- Displays time in **12-hour** or **24-hour** format with an optional seconds display.
- Real-time clock update every second.
- Ability to toggle seconds and second tick on/off.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java AWT/Swing** for GUI components.
- **Calendar** and **Date** classes for time management.

## Future Enhancements:
- Add customizable skins for the clock.
- Implement time zone functionality.
